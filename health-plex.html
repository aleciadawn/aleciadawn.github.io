          <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
          <h4>USER SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS</h4>
          <p>The first step in the process was discussing goals and limitations of the client.
            Next, I sent out a survey to both members and non-members. The survey received resoponses from 12 non-members and six members. Of the non-members surveyed, three did not have any type of gym membership. Based on the findings of the survey along with 3 personal interviews, I anazlyzed the original site to identify the main pain pain points the client was experiencing with their site and made sure to prioritze those points through the remander of my design process</p>
