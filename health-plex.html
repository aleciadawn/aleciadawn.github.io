      <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
      <h4>USER SURVEYS & INTERVIEWS | PERSONAS | USER STORIES</h4>
      <p>The first step in the process was discussing goals and limitations of the client.
        Next, I sent out a survey to both members and non-members. The survey received resoponses from 12 non-members and six members. Of the non-members surveyed, three did not have any type of gym membership. Based on the findings of the survey along with 3 personal interviews, I anazlyzed the original site to identify the main pain pain points the client was experiencing with their site and made sure to prioritze those points through the remander of my design process

            <h4>PERSONAS | USER STORIES</h4>
            <p>
              Once the feedback and analysis was done, it was time to move on to creating personas based on the survey.
              Based on the survey results I created 5 outlines of user personas and then interviewed real people to check my work and add details to the characters I created.
              My priority was to understand each user's motiation to go to the gym, and how my site design could increase the chances of them not only joining, but continue to show up and stay long-term members.
              After creating the personas, I outlined user stories to meet the needs of each personas, prioritizing the needs that overlapped the most.

      <h4>LOGO REDESIGN | STYLE GUIDE</h4>

      <div class="brand column half"> <!--text half -->
        <h4>TYPOGRAPHY</h4>
        <p>I wanted to pair a strong powerful typeface with a clean and modern one. I chose to pair Abolition with Monsterrat Extra Light.
        </p>

        <h4>COLOR PALETTE</h4>
        <p>I chose the color palette based on the old logo which is still on the sign outside of the gym. Black is the predominant color of the site with the others following as accent colors.
        </p>

        <h4>LOGO</h4>
        <p>
        Similar to the color palette, the logo design was a modernization of the previous logo.
        I opted to stick with a slab-serif as a nod to the 1980s origin of the gym.
        I went with a thin, wide, italicized font for "fitness center" to contrast the powerful boldness of "Health Plex".

      <h4> SOFTWARE: BALSAMIQ & SKETCH </h4>
      <p>
        Prior to designing the pages, I sketched out a site map with the user flow on paper.
        I used color coding to identify the user interaction with the sitemap, and highlighted the top page priorities based on the user research.
        The low-fidelity wireframes were created using Balsamiq, and once I had those complete, I moved on to incorporate the style guide and created high-fidelity wireframes using Sketch.

    <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
    <h4>PROTOTYPING | USER TESTING | DEVELOPMENT</h4>
    <p>
      I used InVision to create a site prototype and observed users navigating the site. I began the observation with the following prompt:
      <br></br>
      <b>"Pretend you hav just moved to a new city and are looking to join a gym, use this site to determine whether you would consider this gym as a top contender."</b>
      <br></br>
      After taking notes of their first moves I checked to see if their priorities aligned with the researhc done at the beginning of the process.
      Then, I had each user move through tasks I created from the user flows. Here are some examples of tasks I asked of the users:
      <br></br>
        <b>1. "Identify a fitness class you would like to attend and tell me how much it would cost you if you attended as a member."</b>
        <br>
        <b>2. "Tell me if the cost of membership is in your price range"</b>
        <br>
        <b>3. "You are hoping to hire a personal trainer, how would you go about getting a trainer from this gym"</b>
        <br>
        <b>4. "Sign-up for a free-trial."</b>
        <br></br>

      Overall, the feedback was positive. There were a few minor design changes which included resdesign a couple piece of content that a few users thought were buttons when they were not.
