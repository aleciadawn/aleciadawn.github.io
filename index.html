          <p>
            My name is Alecia McMahon and I specialize in user experience and user interface design for web and mobile. I love creating simple, beautiful designs; and more than anything else, I love solving problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my career working in youth development as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Paraguay, South America. After my two year service, I moved to New York for a job at a non-profit organization working with immigrant professionals. I have always been fascinated with the human experience and how we move and interact with the world around us. However, it was taking on extra projects that led me to realize the opportunity, impact - and quite frankly fun - that comes with meshing humans interaction, design, and technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my career transition taking on graphic design work for my non-profit and proceeded to design their email marketing and social media campaigns. After success in my design and marketing work, I moved on to assist with a website redesign project for Upwardly Global. After finding a true passion in working on these projects I opted to dive all in and I enrolled in a full-time design program with Bloc.io.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since enrolling in the program, I have had the opportunity to with a number of Senior UX Designers and Product Designers. Each playing a unique and vital role in the progress of my development as a designer. Additionally, I have designed responsive sites for a variety of clients, along with sites and mobile apps for the design program within Bloc.
          </p>
          <p>
            With my eclectic professional background comes unique experience and understanding that has proved advantageous as I design for different clients. Throughout my career, I have led teams, redesigned programs, managed projects, handled PR and marketing communications, presented projects, and had the pleasure of working in a wide variety of settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm doing freelance work as I finish Bloc's design program.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are looking for a designer - or just want to meet up for coffee - drop me a line. Don't be shy!
